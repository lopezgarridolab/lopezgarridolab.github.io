Welcome to our webpage! We are a research group currently at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl√∂n. The group works mainly using genetics, biochemistry and imaging techniques to study, among other things, the sporulation and physiology in _Bacillus subtilis_.

To know more about what we do and how we do it, please take a look at the Research tab. If you wish to join our group, check out for available options at the Opportunities tab.
