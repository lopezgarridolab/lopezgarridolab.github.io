We combine classical bacterial genetics with cutting-edge cell biological tools to study in mechanistic detail the workings and evolution of bacterial cells.  We primarily focus on Bacillus subtilis, a genetically tractable bacterium in which we can study the physiology of cell growth and differentiation under standard laboratory conditions or in an experimental evolutionary context.
